#### Update December 28, 2016
- under progress of moving from built-in SQLite to Realm
- speed improvements and bugs fixed
- chosen image files to use will no longer be kept if user removes preview image or exits adding/updating Moment fragment (dramatically reduced app usage)
- migrated from Picasso to Glide which led to images being load faster (and fixed a glitch where images would not load on app restart)

#### Update June 29, 2016
- original version of app first created
